I have been working at the Metis site today.

I caught an earlier train immediately after dropping my daughter off at high school.  It is still rather close
and depends on finding parking and walking to the train stop in time.  But that's the express train.  It is
actually about two-thirds the travel time.  If I miss that one, the next available train should get me
down here in time before things start for the day.

Last night I caught a curiosity.  I find a remark that a particular event shouldn't be deemed terribly
noteworthy because it's still within the customary 5% confidence level.  That seemed like something I could
try to replicate.  I continued that effort today.  For a while I was conviced the comment was wrong
because the significance seemed much greater.  The trouble was that I had missed an implicit assumption
about the data table I was reading.  I replicated the work properly and had to agree with the comment.

What was good about this endeavor, this curiosity, was that I was able to go "out there" and find the
data and bring it back through data cleaning, munging, through Pandas and use the same techniques I've
been learning in these MOOCs.

This is the sort of thing I foresee we'll be doing a lot in this Metis Bootcamp.  Take the techniques
and go out in the wild to see what fun we can have.

Today, the actual instructors are down here.  They're working through their overall plans since it will
be a team taught experience.  I had a bit of time to talk.  But like Wednesday, I'm not really supposed
to be here.  So when or if they leave, I'll have to pack up and head out.

I also made good progress in the MOOC.  I should have no problem finishing up the second course before
the bootcamp.  But I may not be able to keep up even a slowed pace on the next two courses.  David (one
of the instructors) was rather skeptical of that idea.  No worries.  The main idea behind the Harvard
series was to prepare me for the bootcamp.  If the bootcamp demands preempts it, this will be fine.

The recent work in this MOOC was interesting.  I had to learn a new Python module as I mirror the
work.  The module is patsy.  It was rather specifically built to mimic or match the functionality
in R.  But... it is slightly different enough to have given me a bit of work to understand it.  The
interesting thing is apparently there are some ways it improved upon the behavior in R.
