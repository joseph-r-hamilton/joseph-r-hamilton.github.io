Project Fletcher began a while ago...

I guess you might say as far as blogging goes, the cat caught my tongue.

I have not yet finished blogging about Project McNulty.

Which is hilarious because the storytelling part about that project was that some
nefarious group imprisoned my blog.  Lo and behold if that didn't happen in effect.

I often see graduates from previous cohorts milling around the Metis campus.
It seems very worthwhile to see what they're up to or to ask them about their
experiences.  A fair amount of the time, they're working with Ashley.  Some times,
they're just coming in on a regular, if infrequent, basis and they spend their
time working on some skill or another.  But one high runner for activities is
polishing up their past projects either in their blog or in their GitHub repositories.

Heavens, if I've not created the same problem for myself.

I was behind on the last project due to planned and unplanned absences.  The instructors
gave me a grace day and I presented a day after everyone else.  They were also understanding
in the sense that they didn't expect or require me to submit or publish my material on the
same schedule as everyone else.  But I didn't realize they weren't going to wait for that
to grade my work.  I'm not surprised.  They make the rounds almost every day to check up
on our progress.  Between that and us pestering them, they have a good sense of what we're
doing.  That and the presentation itself is a good metric.

In any case, the trouble was that my lag on ending Project Three meant I was already bleeding
into the time where everyone else was working on Project Four.  And if that wasn't enough
I have started my research and work leading to my next Investigation.

My focus is wildly split now.  And Project Three is the only thing where there's no real pressure.
The others have deadlines.  Nonetheless, there's one thing I wish to do before I publish Project
Three... so it's gonna linger for a bit...

In any case, Project Four is NLP and Unsupervised Learning, both of which can be... umm... a
tad weird.  I chose two optional scopes for the project.  We each had a private meeting with
the instructors to go over these.  Yet again, I found myself with an incorrect assessment of
which would be harder.  I knew which would be more direct and in line with the lectures, etc.
But it's not just that the other would be a bit harder... apparently it would have been much
more difficult in the time frame available.  In my scope review meeting with the instructors, I
asked about how we would measure success for this project.  The previous two projects had various
metrics.  The response was interesting...

"When you have something that makes sense."

Well... a bit of experimentation with Topic Modeling, and I have a much deeper appreciation for
that statement.

Another intriguing aspect of this project is that I may actually take advantage of the AWS servers.
I may not truly need such if I limit my scope.  But to scale up, it seems very likely I'll actually
benefit.  I don't need an EC2 instance for MongoDB.  I just dumped stuff to my local MongoDB server
I had running since Project Two.  But, I may need some extra horsepower.  We'll have to see what I
can accomplish...
