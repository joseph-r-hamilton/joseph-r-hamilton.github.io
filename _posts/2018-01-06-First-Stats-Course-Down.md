Wow!

I am **DONE** with the first course: Statistics and R.

I had no significant problem mirroring the entire coursework in R and Python.

But... I learned to be wary of the Python module that lets you directly interface to R.  Oh it *works* well enough.  Well... it works great in Spyder and Jupyter since the paths are all set up via Anaconda.  I've not gotten Rodeo to agree where R is.  But... there are some interesting oddities when trying to convert the data sets available innately in R.  It doesn't always do what you expect.  To be safe, it's often better just to dump it to CSV and read it back in from Python.

Time to move on to the second course: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra.
