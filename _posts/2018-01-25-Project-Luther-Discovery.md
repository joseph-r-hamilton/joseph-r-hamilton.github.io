Project Luther is in motion.

For Project Luther, I need to move quickly towards a MVP (Minimal Vialble
Product).  This has been broken into two parts.  I believe the formal MVP
presentation is Monday.  But Friday I must be able to show I've already begun
to collect data.  This projects has two key aspects: Web Scraping; Linear
Regression.  So to a degree the MVP for the Scraping is tomorrow.

I've performed a bit of Exploration and Discovery.  I played with Selenium
and the websites for four of the counties of the Chicagoland area:
* Cook
* DuPage
* Lake
* Will

I evaluated these for ease of access as well as for the amount and type of
data I could procure.  For the purpose of the MVP I have settled on Will
countly alone.

Next, due to the need to show data tomorrow, I cannot do start as I'd hoped.
I do want to start to switch to CI.  But I dare not waste time on getting that
part working.

Hilarously, I already have a template project to pull from for the web
scraping.  I will likely create a writeup for that project in the near future.

PLACEHOLDER (I'll come back here later and create a link to it).

But just because I cannot immediately integrate CI doesn't mean I shouldn't go
ahead and start the repository.  So here's the short-term plan...

1. Create the repository for GitHub
1. Use Jupyter, Selenium and BeautifulSoup for prototyping
1. Begin development with Scrapy
1. Incorporate Mongo for storage
1. Pull some data
