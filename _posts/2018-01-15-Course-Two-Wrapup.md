Finished with Course Two!!

I have finished the second course in the Harvard series.

I've given some thought with regards to "what next".

In general, I consider this course series and the book it's tied to is a very worthwhile experience
overall.  Nonetheless, I'm not entirely certain this was what I expected or that it met my needs
with regards to a refresher on Linear Algebra.

I did not get "past" where I'd gotten with my earlier work on HackerRank.  But I certainly went deeper. 
Furthermore, I got a better grounding in how to connect this sort of regression overall to basic
statistics.  And this certainly showed how to use this relative to experiments.

But...

That's the entire thing.  This whole Harvard series is focused on this one aspect of using statistics.

When I fall back and compare the context of this text and course series relative to the Metis Bootcamp
curriculum I can easily see a difference between depth and breadth.  Then when I compare the Metis Bootcamp
curriculum to the broad overview of Data Science topics in general, I can see that even that is but a sampling.

So... I'm going to pause entirely on the Harvard series for a while.  Instead, I'm going to focus on the
topics covered by the Bootcamp while pushing through a couple other textbooks in the background.
