Guess what... I've **already** benifitted from setting up a snapshot regimen.

Yup.  That didn't take long.  I made a global subsitute in a file where I should have specified
only the lines after the cursor.  I didn't realize what I'd done.  But I was making blogging changes
with Jekyll in update mode.  So I could **see** I'd screwed something up immediately but I couldn't
tell what.  And attempting to undo it didn't work.

A quick peek into the snapshots directory and it became clear I'd screwed up the YAML header stuff.
Again... YAML is **PICKY**!!

I loved having this many years ago on Solaris.  So I knew of the benefit of having it.  And I imagined
I'd need it to protet myself from myself.  I didn't expect to need it so soon.  :grin:
