Tonight, I stayed after the Bootcamp to join the Metis Open House.

It's a strange experience to participate in another Open House on the other side of
the Bootcamp process.

And it's **IMMENSELY** surreal to hear Alice, one of the Instructors, describe how
much fun it is for the instructors to push us through high-pressure, fast projects.

Chuckle...

But... there's free food.  And it was good food.  Giordano's pizza!!

And it seemed good to stay here and focus on the current project.

But... this second project has ended up a tad strange.  The instructors really guided
us to segment the work on this project.  So, for me, this meant today was Analysis.
Scraping was supposed to be done.  I actually had set my spiders such that they could
just run in the background.  So while I did analyisis today, the spiders increased my
record count from 50k to 60k.  Tomorrow the focus is on the Presentation.

For some projects, the analysis could go on forever.  But there's not much you can
do with bad data.  If there is no signal to capture, you get the pleasure of doing
nothing other than proving that point.  So, to a degree today's been a bit of winding
down.  I'm focusing on methodology and at least creating good Jupyter Notebooks that
can be useful later.

About half the cohort stayed for the Open House.  Tiffany even brought her husband along.

We were informed there would be a couple past alumni presenting their projects.  Then
Nathan told us today that was a miscommunication.  Finally, it seems he found someone
to present, at least here in Chicago.  This was actually the major draw for me.  I
don't really need to hear the pitch all over again.  But getting more ideas for the
Passon Project will certainly be helpful.
