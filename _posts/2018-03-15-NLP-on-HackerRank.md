I've identified tracks in HackerRank to coincide with Project 4.

Similar to Project Three, I thought it would be useful to progress through the related material
on HackerRank.  And as before, it was indeed uScores seful.  You don't get the whizbang toolsets to
help you.  No SciKit Learn... No Gensim... No NLTK.  Nope.  It really does help to learn things
if you are forced to fall back and essentially code things from scratch.  And, you may learn
a lot more along the way.

For example, as I coded TF-IDF from scratch, I read the Wikipedia page on TF-IDF.  Nothing
previous had underscored that there really isn't just one TF-IDF algorithm.  There are many
variations.

So, I chose the Regular Expression (Regex) track and the Natural Language Processing (NLP) section
withing the Machine Learning track.

Alas... although it was and is helpful, it was also robust enough I couldn't finish in the
time frame of Project 4.  I plowed all through the "learning" challenge sections for RegEx.  But
the last section is full of near-real-world applications.  I just couldn't devote the time.
And the NLP section... sheesh.  That's really going to take some time.

I'm accumulating no small amount of curiosities and goals for things to pursue after the Metis
bootcamp.

For Project 5, I'm starting to use Spark which depends on Scala.  So, in the same spirit, I
should jump on the Functional Programming track on Hacker Rank.  But... it's going to have to wait.
