I **love** HackerRank.

I'm dropping a note here for a few reasons.  First, I need some blog posts as I move to test or implement desired functionality.  I have an idea of what I need the blog to be able to support.   But to be able to try it out, I have to fluff out the number of posts and categories and tags in play.

Next, I'm going to start back posting by yanking notes from other stores or just back creating based on when I did or completed various things.

But right now, this is just a brief note on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and what I've been doing with it.  I was introduced to HackerRank at one of the Metis meetings discussing the Bootcamp.  It was listed as one of the ways to prepare.  In order to get used to it, I started on the tracks of things I already knew.  I pushed through and completed the Linux Shell and Python tracks fairly quickly.  Then I started focusing on the things that seemed most appropriate to prepare for the Metis Bootcamp.

At the moment, I'm progressing through the "10 days of Javascript" track to refresh on Javascript before bouncing to other sites to work more on both Javascript and CSS in preparation for D3.  For some reason, it gave me access to all of it at once.  When I did the "10 days of Statistics" it opened more each day.
