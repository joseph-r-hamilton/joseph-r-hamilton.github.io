Pair Programming is... umm... interesting.

The structure of the Metis Data is broken down such that we cover different things simultaneously,
concurrently rather than just a deep focus on one thing.

The projects are the emphasis.  So, it is really easy to fall into a mode (or mood) where you're
absorbed by or focused on the project of the moment.  The lectures and "other things" serve to
break that.

One of these "things" is ***Pair Programming***.

Every day starts with about half-an-hour of Pair Programming.

Pair Programming serves many purposes:

* The instructors get a chance to see the students' code on a regular, daily basis.  It's one thing
to tell the students about certain practices of coding Python.  It's another thing to confirm or
chastise students to verify they are incorporating these practices.
* Working in pairs forces people to work together.  Only person gets the computer.  But either may
have the idea.  Nonetheless, you have to communicate and the other can critique accordingly.
* These are timed exercises.  So the pressure is on.  This then simulates the experience of code
interviews where in a job interview you have to code or whiteboard.  The types of problems are
also similar to the kind you'd experience in code interviews.
