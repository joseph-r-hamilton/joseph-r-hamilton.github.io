My family has been hit by the flu.

You can prepare all you want for all kinds of mishaps.  But you cannot
prevent them.

I'll not be the first in the cohort to be absent due to illness.  Amy won
that prize.  But I will have to take a couple days absence this week.

Fortunately (so far) it's not me.  Oh, I've been nursing my own bugs.
But my stuff has been annoying sinusitis.  What did the doctor call it?
I think she said it was "sub-acute sinusitis".  The "sub" part is easy
to diagnose.  If it's not "sub-acute" you don't wait several weeks to
go to the doctor.  In any case, I did go to the doctor after the first
week of the Bootcamp.  That may have been incredibly fortuitous because
I got the flu shot while I was there.  I hope that helps protect me.

My son showed significant symptoms Sunday morning and my daughter
succumbed late yesterday afternoon..

Oh yeah... I'd better call that attendance line...  Come to think of it,
I wonder if my wife called it yesterday...

I alerted the Metis instructors that this week might be dicey.  My wife
shifted some responsibilities off to coworkers and took Monday and Tuesday
off.  Alice suggested later this week might be feasible for me to stay
home and work remotely.

There may be no "good" time to deck out of this intensive bootcamp.
But this may be better than other times.  The third project is just beginning.
I give my first investigation this afternoon.

I just hope I don't the flu myself.  That would be... bad... very bad.
