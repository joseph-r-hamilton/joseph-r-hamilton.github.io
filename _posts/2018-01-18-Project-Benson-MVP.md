Project Benson is past MVP.

**MVP = Minimal Viable Product**

We presented our MVP early this afternoon.  For us, this meant presenting a Jupyter Notebook
that highlighted our methodology crunching the data for one week and turning that into a ranked
order of stations by traffic.

There are three teams in the entire cohort.

This isn't a competition so much but all the teams are essentially tackling the same problem.
Since the entire cohort is the audience for the presentations, it is *very* interesting because
we may all be at different points of the discovery or be using different strategies entirely.

Each team's presentations had different strengths, etc.

Our team was the only one that had incorporated the technique of resampling for time series.

Another team was the only one who had punched through Tableau for some pretty pictures.

The third team was the only one which had decided to incorporate the geographical data of tech
companies in the greater New York area.

There's precious little time left.  We have to have practiced the presentation by end-of-day tomorrow.
