	<h1>About Joseph Hamilton</h1>
	<p>I love Data Science.</p>
  <p>I have had a several phases of my career as a part of my journey towards Data Science.  I started in Telecommunications
    as a Software Tester and learned how to document standard procedures and then wrap them up in automation to increase
    efficiency and productivity.  I bounced to Wireless and travelled the globe and all across North America to serve
    Wireless Service providers honing a variety of skills such as ETL and general database engineering/management
    techniques involving relational databases.  After this I segued into the role of Solutions Manager employing
    statistical and database techniques to create services and to perform various analyses from a business and Sales
    perspective.</p>
  <p>I look forward to learning many new aspects of Data Science.</p>
