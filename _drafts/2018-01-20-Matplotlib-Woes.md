Visualization in Python can be frustraing!

Alright.  I'm running into some stuff that is bizarre enough I feel it important to drop in a post
or two.  That's because there are some oddities here I'm likely to face again.

These things seem a bit weirder than fighting to learn how to manage MultiIndex with Pandas or
how to actually make use of DateTimeIndex.  Definitely weirder than a usual bug.

The trouble or benefit of using Python for visualization is that there are so many options.
These different libraries may increase your options, but they also make it difficult to determine
how to do any one little thing.

And... these libraries may be tripping all over each other.
