  Learn Python in Python.  SwirlyPy teaches you Python programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the Interactive Python console!  Swirlypy is a port of Swirl (R) which is a platform for learning (and teaching) statistics and Python simultaneously and interactively. It presents a choice of course lessons and interactively tutors a user through them. A user may be asked to watch a video, to answer a multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blanks question, or to enter a command in the Python console.
