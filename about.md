I have had a several phases of my career as a part of my journey towards Data Science.
I started in Telecommunications as a Software Tester and learned how to document standard
procedures and then wrap them up in automation to increase efficiency and productivity. 
I bounced to Wireless and travelled the globe and all across North America to serve
Wireless Service providers honing a variety of skills such as ETL and general database engineering/management
techniques involving relational databases.  After this I segued into the role of Solutions Manager employing
statistical and database techniques to create services and to perform various analyses from a business and Sales
perspective.

I look forward to learning many new aspects of Data Science.
