&lt;p&gt;More notebooks I developed as I played around with the data…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;frustration&quot;&gt;Frustration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/joseph-r-hamilton/Project_Benson/blob/master/Exploration/Project%20Benson%20-%20Exploration%2002.ipynb&quot;&gt;Project Benson - Exploration 02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to work on an approach using Resampling and Interpolation.  I wanted this done with a MultiIndex.
It seemed tricky but I got it working easily enough…  Except that it returned negative numbers.
For the next day, I backed off and worked in an entirely different manner.  When I finally got that working
and &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; had negative results, I finally went back and explored the source data only to discover that
some of the turnstile are counting backwards.  The negative results were fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve abandoned this alternative approach.  But it was a good exercise nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cleanup-analysis&quot;&gt;Cleanup Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/joseph-r-hamilton/Project_Benson/blob/master/Exploration/Project%20Benson%20-%20Exploration%2003b.ipynb&quot;&gt;Project Benson - Exploration 03b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After returning to the straightforward method, the next step was to try to determine how to clean things up.
Part of this analysis highlighted a need to tweak my methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, however, I had to determine how to handle truly anomalous information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-clean-notebook&quot;&gt;A Clean Notebook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/joseph-r-hamilton/Project_Benson/blob/master/Exploration/Project%20Benson%20-%20Exploration%2005.ipynb&quot;&gt;Project Benson - Exploration 05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working out methods for Data Cleanup and Aggregation, I created this notebook to serve as a clean way
to show the process, to share with the team and to present to the larger audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can then serve as a springboard for further analysis and processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Project Benson - More Data Exploration</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Project Benson MVP</title><link href="/project/benson/2018/01/18/Project-Benson-MVP/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Project Benson MVP" /><published>2018-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/project/benson/2018/01/18/Project-Benson-MVP</id><content type="html" xml:base="/project/benson/2018/01/18/Project-Benson-MVP/">&lt;p&gt;Project Benson is past MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MVP = Minimal Viable Product&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We presented our MVP early this afternoon.  For us, this meant presenting a Jupyter Notebook
that highlighted our methodology crunching the data for one week and turning that into a ranked
order of stations by traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three teams in the entire cohort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a competition so much but all the teams are essentially tackling the same problem.
Since the entire cohort is the audience for the presentations, it is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; interesting because
we may all be at different points of the discovery or be using different strategies entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each team’s presentations had different strengths, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team was the only one that had incorporated the technique of resampling for time series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another team was the only one who had punched through Tableau for some pretty pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third team was the only one which had decided to incorporate the geographical data of tech
companies in the greater New York area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s precious little time left.  We have to have practiced the presentation by end-of-day tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Project Benson is past MVP.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bootcamp - Pair Programming</title><link href="/metis/2018/01/18/Bootcamp-Pair-Programming/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bootcamp - Pair Programming" /><published>2018-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/metis/2018/01/18/Bootcamp-Pair-Programming</id><content type="html" xml:base="/metis/2018/01/18/Bootcamp-Pair-Programming/">&lt;p&gt;Pair Programming is… umm… interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of the Metis Data is broken down such that we cover different things simultaneously,
concurrently rather than just a deep focus on one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projects are the emphasis.  So, it is really easy to fall into a mode (or mood) where you’re
absorbed by or focused on the project of the moment.  The lectures and “other things” serve to
break that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these “things” is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pair Programming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day starts with about half-an-hour of Pair Programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair Programming serves many purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The instructors get a chance to see the students’ code on a regular, daily basis.  It’s one thing
to tell the students about certain practices of coding Python.  It’s another thing to confirm or
chastise students to verify they are incorporating these practices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working in pairs forces people to work together.  Only person gets the computer.  But either may
have the idea.  Nonetheless, you have to communicate and the other can critique accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These are timed exercises.  So the pressure is on.  This then simulates the experience of code
interviews where in a job interview you have to code or whiteboard.  The types of problems are
also similar to the kind you’d experience in code interviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Pair Programming is… umm… interesting.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Project Benson Progresses</title><link href="/project/benson/2018/01/17/Project-Benson-Progresses/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Project Benson Progresses" /><published>2018-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/project/benson/2018/01/17/Project-Benson-Progresses</id><content type="html" xml:base="/project/benson/2018/01/17/Project-Benson-Progresses/">&lt;p&gt;Project Benson is underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK.  The last 24 hours have been somewhat of a rollercoaster with regards to Project Benson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a fair amount of time pursuing the data from a Exploratory Data Analysis point of view.
And I simply loved it.  It was good practice with Pandas.  I learned several new aspects of how
to use Pandas for time series sorts of data.  It was also frustrating when I got stuck trying
to do things that appeared to work but didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the morning Alice reminded us that good Data Scientists do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; jump right into the data
searching for things that can be done with the data.  A Data Science project begins with Design.
This was a repeat.  I’m pretty sure she said the same thing yesterday.  But… it was bewildering
then and it was chastening today.  Because… the data is so much FUN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a number of traps and pitfalls here.  First of all, we may end up either limited by focusing
too much on the data at hand or simply incredibly biased because of this focus.  Next, we can spend
a lot of time pleasing ourselves or attempting to build monuments which may be overkill or mismatched
compared to what anyone ever really wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… how do you do Design before jumping into the Data?  We discussed this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;listen&lt;/strong&gt; to your Customers.  Learn what problems they want solved.  Discern what may be
a threshold of satisfaction or a point of diminishing returns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;brainstorm&lt;/strong&gt;.  Think about the problem.  Ponder how you’ll approach the challenge.  Draft your goals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine a &lt;strong&gt;MVP - Minimum Viable Product&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach should help to guide the overall effort.  It also sets you up for an iterative method
where you can have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to show for your work ASAP but then build upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… what did we do?  Jump back into the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well.. that’s not entirely true.  We spent a lot of time debating methodology… about the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nah… we hastily determined our MVP would be simply a ranked list of the MTA stations based on traffic flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the trouble here is determining how to assess this.  The “fun” part of the MTA data is this isn’t actually
quite readily availble.  You must massage the data a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kendall and I discovered each of us had wrestled with trying to determine the structure behind the data.
We still cannot quite figure out what some of it actually means.  Oh we could figure out what to count.
But… there were hints that you might be able to say more if you undertood more of what it represented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point I described what I’d been doing with standardizing and interpolating by resampling the data.
Kendall and I debated that a lot because her Math/Stats background made her leery of interpolation, especially
dumb linear interpolation.  Dean jumped in and we explored this a bit.  But it wasn’t clear any other thing
we were discussing would be any easier or better.  Derrick stayed quiet and simply plugged away at another
approach altogether.  When he shared his idea, we pointed out the errors inherent in that approach and guided
him how to continue with it by aggregating up to the STATION level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our approaches have errors.  Linear interpolation makes assumptions about the rate between the
interpolation.  But so do alternative approaches based on other distributions.  Derrick’s approach bumped
up the granurality to 1 day but with known errors around midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re continuing to work on anything and everything.  But we selected Derrick’s approach because it’s
easier to do quicker.  And… boy is this projecting being rushed!  Dean typed up our Design Statement
and submitted it.  Our MVP is due tomorrow, less than 48 hours after the project started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if I get the interpolation working it would permit us to the same 4-hour granularity, or
lower as long as we remember it’s interpolated.  And it would very likley corroborate the per-day
approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Project Benson is underway.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Saved by Snapshots</title><link href="/metis/2018/01/16/Saved-By-Snapshots/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Saved by Snapshots" /><published>2018-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/metis/2018/01/16/Saved-By-Snapshots</id><content type="html" xml:base="/metis/2018/01/16/Saved-By-Snapshots/">&lt;p&gt;Guess what… I’ve &lt;strong&gt;already&lt;/strong&gt; benifitted from setting up a snapshot regimen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup.  That didn’t take long.  I made a global subsitute in a file where I should have specified
only the lines after the cursor.  I didn’t realize what I’d done.  But I was making blogging changes
with Jekyll in update mode.  So I could &lt;strong&gt;see&lt;/strong&gt; I’d screwed something up immediately but I couldn’t
tell what.  And attempting to undo it didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick peek into the snapshots directory and it became clear I’d screwed up the YAML header stuff.
Again… YAML is &lt;strong&gt;PICKY&lt;/strong&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved having this many years ago on Solaris.  So I knew of the benefit of having it.  And I imagined
I’d need it to protet myself from myself.

&lt;p&gt;This includes some investigation, some chaos, some play, some fun, etc.  Working towards what techniques

&lt;p&gt;Wow.  We hit the ground running alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First day of the bootcamp and we’re busy on the first project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projets throughout the Metis Bootcamp seem to trend in a couple of ways.  One trend is from a group
effort to a solo effort.  For this first project, my partners in crime are Dean, Derrick and Kendall.
We sequestered ourselves at the sunny side of the floorspace and barricaded ourselves from the rest of
the world as we discussed how best to attack the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kendall and I were the first to find the data.  But we found it in different places.  And it’s good that
we did so.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mta.info/developers/download.html&quot;&gt;MTA site&lt;/a&gt; provides the data in smaller
chunks, which should prove more amenable to rapid prototyping.  But as Kendall dug into the data available
on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.ny.gov/&quot;&gt;New York site&lt;/a&gt; site, we realized it was the same data, same columns, but…
the data was available in entirety, millions of rows of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chatted about what to look for… or how to use the data available.  Did we care about location down
the level of which street exit of any particular station?  Should we focus on Spring traffic since the
problem statement suggested an event at the start of Summer?  Dare we try to accommodate or consider
the effect of Spring Break?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at the data enough to realize we had some data munging to do so we clearly needed something
in the fashion of people per unit time at any station while the turnstile data is just reporting a
(supposedly) ever increasing count of the actual turnstile reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We broke with the idea that we should first play with the data more and then we could scale or filter
as we chose.  Furthermore, Dean stated he would attempt to work in Tableau since he had access to that.
This is one of those benefits to the group aspect of the Metis Bootcamp.  We all bring different things
to the table and can share and learn from one another.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Project Benson has begun.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bootcamp - Day One</title><link href="/metis/2018/01/16/Bootcamp-Day-One/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bootcamp - Day One" /><published>2018-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/metis/2018/01/16/Bootcamp-Day-One</id><content type="html" xml:base="/metis/2018/01/16/Bootcamp-Day-One/">&lt;p&gt;Bootcamp has begun!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize I’ve not yet published a post describing the Metis Bootcamp, or my motivations for pursuing
colloboration wtih Metis to jump into a career in Data Science.  I may have to get to that soon…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m starting this post while Alice is lecturing about command line.  A fair amount of the first week
is going to be somewhat old hat for me.  So I should have lots of bandwidth to do other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is a bit of an illusion.  The instructors (David and Alice) actually discussed this earlier
in their introductory presentations.  They fully expect that each and every one of us will hit a wall
at some point in the bootcamp.  It just will be different for each person.  I believe for me it will
be at about the third week.  That’s because we all can see the curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bootcamp starts with the basics.  This is largely because all of us are coming from different
backgrounds.  Many of us will have different sets of strengths and weaknesses.  We could see this
after all the introductions.  It’s a fascinating mix.  I seem to be the only one coming from a
telecommunications industry background.  There are some “things” that seem to be represented by
more than one person, like Psychology, Economics.  There’s one person who is a former recruiter.
There’s another who actually is coming from a Data Analytics background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But… thing are going to shift into warp speed rather soon.  They repeated the concept there there
will be a “core” set of things that we repeat and stress and will be expected to “master”.  But the
bootcamp also covers a sufficient amount of things in a broad overview fashion such that pretty much
nobody can master everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next… we’re all coming in with slightly different laptop configurations.  The suggested thing is
MacOS.  I’m using Linux in a Virtual Machine on top of Windows.  Kendall has a Windows laptop and
has installed an Unbuntu app.  I had to look into that.  Apparently, Microsoft and Ubuntu have
colloborated to put an app in the Windows App Store which is accessible for Windows 10.  What you
end up with is something like a Docker container to provide you with a Linux shell.  It doesn’t
seem to support a GUI.  So… it seems to be something like Cygwin on steroids… or more appropriately
a real Linux… but only the shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may not need this now… especially since I have a robust VM.  But this is interesting nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also just learned about “NerdTree” - a plugin for vim.  I’m so much an old-timer that when Amy
asked me if I used “vim” it didn’t register to me… because I know it as “Vee-Eye”.  But to be honest
I DO use vi rather tham vim or gvim.  But I may have try this one.  I may not feel it as a “need”
so much because I’m just so used to using vi without this.  But I believe this is what I’ve seen
others using on the train.  And it’s not just that this plugin shows the directory structure…
it shows git status as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what’s fun about this sort of group experience… learning from each other all the nifty
things and tricks that are out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the start of actual instruction, today involved several introdoction presentations.
Nathan (Program Manager) explained policies (attendance policy?!?  &lt;strong&gt;grades&lt;/strong&gt; ?!?).  Ashley (Career Advisor)
went over the support Metis provides overall to assist with the Career Support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the interesting aspect of this bootcamp.  Metis is very focused on placement.  The Metis
bootcamp is audited.  Their auditor does require employment/placement tracking.  This seems rather
different from the training provided via WorkNet… where the junior colleges or universities don’t do
this so much and even WorkNet may be more focused on ensuring you get any external certification tied
to that course.  As such, quite literally the Metis Bootcamp may be viewed as a Career Placement effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More instruction and then eventually we formed groups and began work on the first project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Bootcamp has begun!!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stats Series - Course Two Wrapup</title><link href="/training/ph_525_series/2018/01/15/Course-Two-Wrapup/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stats Series - Course Two Wrapup" /><published>2018-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/training/ph_525_series/2018/01/15/Course-Two-Wrapup</id><content type="html" xml:base="/training/ph_525_series/2018/01/15/Course-Two-Wrapup/">&lt;p&gt;Finished with Course Two!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have finished the second course in the Harvard series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve given some thought with regards to “what next”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I consider this course series and the book it’s tied to is a very worthwhile experience
overall.  Nonetheless, I’m not entirely certain this was what I expected or that it met my needs
with regards to a refresher on Linear Algebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not get “past” where I’d gotten with my earlier work on HackerRank.  But I certainly went deeper. 
Furthermore, I got a better grounding in how to connect this sort of regression overall to basic
statistics.  And this certainly showed how to use this relative to experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the entire thing.  This whole Harvard series is focused on this one aspect of using statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I fall back and compare the context of this text and course series relative to the Metis Bootcamp
curriculum I can easily see a difference between depth and breadth.  Then when I compare the Metis Bootcamp
curriculum to the broad overview of Data Science topics in general, I can see that even that is but a sampling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… I’m going to pause entirely on the Harvard series for a while.  Instead, I’m going to focus on the
topics covered by the Bootcamp while pushing through a couple other textbooks in the background.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Statistics" /><category term="Harvard" /><summary type="html">Finished with Course Two!!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bootcamp - Final Prep</title><link href="/metis/2018/01/15/Bootcamp-Final-Prep/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bootcamp - Final Prep" /><published>2018-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/metis/2018/01/15/Bootcamp-Final-Prep</id><content type="html" xml:base="/metis/2018/01/15/Bootcamp-Final-Prep/">&lt;p&gt;Just one last day before the bootcamp begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve more or less attained what I’d set out to do to prepare.  I finished the first two courses
in the Harvard series.  I’ve brought the blog to a point where it will serve me during the bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remains any number of things I could have done.  But the time is up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I’ve been tackling a number of normal life things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also backed up the virtual machine I’m using for the bootcamp in a low-tech manner.  I simply copied
the entire thing to a USB stick.  This is the 3rd level of what I implemented.  I’ve got an rsync set to
run daily to dump to another part of the host storage.  I’ve got similar timers to give me period
snapshots.  Next, I’ve got a timer to backup to the cloud.  I plan to copy to the USB stick on a weekly
basis.  All of this should keep me from too much delay from anything from shooting myself in the foot
