&lt;p&gt;The structure of the Metis Data is broken down such that we cover different things simultaneously,
concurrently rather than just a deep focus on one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projects are the emphasis.  So, it is really easy to fall into a mode (or mood) where you’re
absorbed by or focused on the project of the moment.  The lectures and “other things” serve to
break that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these “things” is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pair Programming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day starts with about half-an-hour of Pair Programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair Programming serves many purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The instructors get a chance to see the students’ code on a regular, daily basis.  It’s one thing
to tell the students about certain practices of coding Python.  It’s another thing to confirm or
chastise students to verify they are incorporating these practices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working in pairs forces people to work together.  Only person gets the computer.  But either may
have the idea.  Nonetheless, you have to communicate and the other can critique accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These are timed exercises.  So the pressure is on.  This then simulates the experience of code
interviews where in a job interview you have to code or whiteboard.  The types of problems are
also similar to the kind you’d experience in code interviews.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK.  The last 24 hours have been somewhat of a rollercoaster with regards to Project Benson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a fair amount of time pursuing the data from a Exploratory Data Analysis point of view.
And I simply loved it.  It was good practice with Pandas.  I learned several new aspects of how
to use Pandas for time series sorts of data.  It was also frustrating when I got stuck trying
to do things that appeared to work but didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the morning Alice reminded us that good Data Scientists do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; jump right into the data
searching for things that can be done with the data.  A Data Science project begins with Design.
This was a repeat.  I’m pretty sure she said the same thing yesterday.  But… it was bewildering
then and it was chastening today.  Because… the data is so much FUN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a number of traps and pitfalls here.  First of all, we may end up either limited by focusing
too much on the data at hand or simply incredibly biased because of this focus.  Next, we can spend
a lot of time pleasing ourselves or attempting to build monuments which may be overkill or mismatched
compared to what anyone ever really wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… how do you do Design before jumping into the Data?  We discussed this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;listen&lt;/strong&gt; to your Customers.  Learn what problems they want solved.  Discern what may be
a threshold of satisfaction or a point of diminishing returns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;brainstorm&lt;/strong&gt;.  Think about the problem.  Ponder how you’ll approach the challenge.  Draft your goals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine a &lt;strong&gt;MVP - Minimum Viable Product&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach should help to guide the overall effort.  It also sets you up for an iterative method
where you can have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to show for your work ASAP but then build upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… what did we do?  Jump back into the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well.. that’s not entirely true.  We spent a lot of time debating methodology… about the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nah… we hastily determined our MVP would be simply a ranked list of the MTA stations based on traffic flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the trouble here is determining how to assess this.  The “fun” part of the MTA data is this isn’t actually
quite readily availble.  You must massage the data a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kendall and I discovered each of us had wrestled with trying to determine the structure behind the data.
We still cannot quite figure out what some of it actually means.  Oh we could figure out what to count.
But… there were hints that you might be able to say more if you undertood more of what it represented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point I described what I’d been doing with standardizing and interpolating by resampling the data.
Kendall and I debated that a lot because her Math/Stats background made her leery of interpolation, especially
dumb linear interpolation.  Dean jumped in and we explored this a bit.  But it wasn’t clear any other thing
we were discussing would be any easier or better.  Derrick stayed quiet and simply plugged away at another
approach altogether.  When he shared his idea, we pointed out the errors inherent in that approach and guided
him how to continue with it by aggregating up to the STATION level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our approaches have errors.  Linear interpolation makes assumptions about the rate between the
interpolation.  But so do alternative approaches based on other distributions.  Derrick’s approach bumped
up the granurality to 1 day but with known errors around midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re continuing to work on anything and everything.  But we selected Derrick’s approach because it’s
easier to do quicker.  And… boy is this projecting being rushed!  Dean typed up our Design Statement
and submitted it.  Our MVP is due tomorrow, less than 48 hours after the project started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if I get the interpolation working it would permit us to the same 4-hour granularity, or
lower as long as we remember it’s interpolated.  And it would very likley corroborate the per-day
approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Project Benson is underway.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Saved by Snapshots</title><link href="/metis/2018/01/16/Saved-By-Snapshots/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Saved by Snapshots" /><published>2018-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/metis/2018/01/16/Saved-By-Snapshots</id><content type="html" xml:base="/metis/2018/01/16/Saved-By-Snapshots/">&lt;p&gt;Guess what… I’ve &lt;strong&gt;already&lt;/strong&gt; benifitted from setting up a snapshot regimen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup.  That didn’t take long.  I made a global subsitute in a file where I should have specified
only the lines after the cursor.  I didn’t realize what I’d done.  But I was making blogging changes
with Jekyll in update mode.  So I could &lt;strong&gt;see&lt;/strong&gt; I’d screwed something up immediately but I couldn’t
tell what.  And attempting to undo it didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick peek into the snapshots directory and it became clear I’d screwed up the YAML header stuff.
Again… YAML is &lt;strong&gt;PICKY&lt;/strong&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved having this many years ago on Solaris.  So I knew of the benefit of having it.  And I imagined
I’d need it to protet myself from myself.  I didn’t expect to need it so soon.  :grin:&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Guess what… I’ve already benifitted from setting up a snapshot regimen.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Project Benson - Data Exploration 01</title><link href="/project/benson/2018/01/16/Project-Benson-X01/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Project Benson - Data Exploration 01" /><published>2018-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/project/benson/2018/01/16/Project-Benson-X01</id><content type="html" xml:base="/project/benson/2018/01/16/Project-Benson-X01/">&lt;p&gt;Project Benson - Data Exploration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the link below to a Jupyter Notebook encapsulating my initial Data Exploration related to Project Benson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes some investigation, some chaos, some play, some fun, etc.  Working towards what techniques
may work for our overall project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow.  We hit the ground running alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First day of the bootcamp and we’re busy on the first project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projets throughout the Metis Bootcamp seem to trend in a couple of ways.  One trend is from a group
effort to a solo effort.  For this first project, my partners in crime are Dean, Derrick and Kendall.
We sequestered ourselves at the sunny side of the floorspace and barricaded ourselves from the rest of
the world as we discussed how best to attack the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kendall and I were the first to find the data.  But we found it in different places.  And it’s good that
we did so.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mta.info/developers/download.html&quot;&gt;MTA site&lt;/a&gt; provides the data in smaller
chunks, which should prove more amenable to rapid prototyping.  But as Kendall dug into the data available
on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.ny.gov/&quot;&gt;New York site&lt;/a&gt; site, we realized it was the same data, same columns, but…
the data was available in entirety, millions of rows of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chatted about what to look for… or how to use the data available.  Did we care about location down
the level of which street exit of any particular station?  Should we focus on Spring traffic since the
problem statement suggested an event at the start of Summer?  Dare we try to accommodate or consider
the effect of Spring Break?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at the data enough to realize we had some data munging to do so we clearly needed something
in the fashion of people per unit time at any station while the turnstile data is just reporting a
(supposedly) ever increasing count of the actual turnstile reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We broke with the idea that we should first play with the data more and then we could scale or filter
as we chose.  Furthermore, Dean stated he would attempt to work in Tableau since he had access to that.
This is one of those benefits to the group aspect of the Metis Bootcamp.  We all bring different things
to the table and can share and learn from one another.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Project Benson has begun.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bootcamp - Day One</title><link href="/metis/2018/01/16/Bootcamp-Day-One/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bootcamp - Day One" /><published>2018-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/metis/2018/01/16/Bootcamp-Day-One</id><content type="html" xml:base="/metis/2018/01/16/Bootcamp-Day-One/">&lt;p&gt;Bootcamp has begun!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize I’ve not yet published a post describing the Metis Bootcamp, or my motivations for pursuing
colloboration wtih Metis to jump into a career in Data Science.  I may have to get to that soon…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m starting this post while Alice is lecturing about command line.  A fair amount of the first week
is going to be somewhat old hat for me.  So I should have lots of bandwidth to do other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is a bit of an illusion.  The instructors (David and Alice) actually discussed this earlier
in their introductory presentations.  They fully expect that each and every one of us will hit a wall
at some point in the bootcamp.  It just will be different for each person.  I believe for me it will
be at about the third week.  That’s because we all can see the curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bootcamp starts with the basics.  This is largely because all of us are coming from different
backgrounds.  Many of us will have different sets of strengths and weaknesses.  We could see this
after all the introductions.  It’s a fascinating mix.  I seem to be the only one coming from a
telecommunications industry background.  There are some “things” that seem to be represented by
more than one person, like Psychology, Economics.  There’s one person who is a former recruiter.
There’s another who actually is coming from a Data Analytics background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But… thing are going to shift into warp speed rather soon.  They repeated the concept there there
will be a “core” set of things that we repeat and stress and will be expected to “master”.  But the
bootcamp also covers a sufficient amount of things in a broad overview fashion such that pretty much
nobody can master everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next… we’re all coming in with slightly different laptop configurations.  The suggested thing is
MacOS.  I’m using Linux in a Virtual Machine on top of Windows.  Kendall has a Windows laptop and
has installed an Unbuntu app.  I had to look into that.  Apparently, Microsoft and Ubuntu have
colloborated to put an app in the Windows App Store which is accessible for Windows 10.  What you
end up with is something like a Docker container to provide you with a Linux shell.  It doesn’t
seem to support a GUI.  So… it seems to be something like Cygwin on steroids… or more appropriately
a real Linux… but only the shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may not need this now… especially since I have a robust VM.  But this is interesting nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also just learned about “NerdTree” - a plugin for vim.  I’m so much an old-timer that when Amy
asked me if I used “vim” it didn’t register to me… because I know it as “Vee-Eye”.  But to be honest
I DO use vi rather tham vim or gvim.  But I may have try this one.  I may not feel it as a “need”
so much because I’m just so used to using vi without this.  But I believe this is what I’ve seen
others using on the train.  And it’s not just that this plugin shows the directory structure…
it shows git status as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what’s fun about this sort of group experience… learning from each other all the nifty
things and tricks that are out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the start of actual instruction, today involved several introdoction presentations.
Nathan (Program Manager) explained policies (attendance policy?!?  &lt;strong&gt;grades&lt;/strong&gt; ?!?).  Ashley (Career Advisor)
went over the support Metis provides overall to assist with the Career Support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the interesting aspect of this bootcamp.  Metis is very focused on placement.  The Metis
bootcamp is audited.  Their auditor does require employment/placement tracking.  This seems rather
different from the training provided via WorkNet… where the junior colleges or universities don’t do
this so much and even WorkNet may be more focused on ensuring you get any external certification tied
to that course.  As such, quite literally the Metis Bootcamp may be viewed as a Career Placement effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More instruction and then eventually we formed groups and began work on the first project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Bootcamp has begun!!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stats Series - Course Two Wrapup</title><link href="/training/ph_525_series/2018/01/15/Course-Two-Wrapup/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stats Series - Course Two Wrapup" /><published>2018-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/training/ph_525_series/2018/01/15/Course-Two-Wrapup</id><content type="html" xml:base="/training/ph_525_series/2018/01/15/Course-Two-Wrapup/">&lt;p&gt;Finished with Course Two!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have finished the second course in the Harvard series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve given some thought with regards to “what next”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I consider this course series and the book it’s tied to is a very worthwhile experience
overall.  Nonetheless, I’m not entirely certain this was what I expected or that it met my needs
with regards to a refresher on Linear Algebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not get “past” where I’d gotten with my earlier work on HackerRank.  But I certainly went deeper. 
Furthermore, I got a better grounding in how to connect this sort of regression overall to basic
statistics.  And this certainly showed how to use this relative to experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the entire thing.  This whole Harvard series is focused on this one aspect of using statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I fall back and compare the context of this text and course series relative to the Metis Bootcamp
curriculum I can easily see a difference between depth and breadth.  Then when I compare the Metis Bootcamp
curriculum to the broad overview of Data Science topics in general, I can see that even that is but a sampling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… I’m going to pause entirely on the Harvard series for a while.  Instead, I’m going to focus on the
topics covered by the Bootcamp while pushing through a couple other textbooks in the background.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Statistics" /><category term="Harvard" /><summary type="html">Finished with Course Two!!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bootcamp - Final Prep</title><link href="/metis/2018/01/15/Bootcamp-Final-Prep/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bootcamp - Final Prep" /><published>2018-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/metis/2018/01/15/Bootcamp-Final-Prep</id><content type="html" xml:base="/metis/2018/01/15/Bootcamp-Final-Prep/">&lt;p&gt;Just one last day before the bootcamp begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve more or less attained what I’d set out to do to prepare.  I finished the first two courses
in the Harvard series.  I’ve brought the blog to a point where it will serve me during the bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remains any number of things I could have done.  But the time is up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I’ve been tackling a number of normal life things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also backed up the virtual machine I’m using for the bootcamp in a low-tech manner.  I simply copied
the entire thing to a USB stick.  This is the 3rd level of what I implemented.  I’ve got an rsync set to
run daily to dump to another part of the host storage.  I’ve got similar timers to give me period
snapshots.  Next, I’ve got a timer to backup to the cloud.  I plan to copy to the USB stick on a weekly
basis.  All of this should keep me from too much delay from anything from shooting myself in the foot
to theft of the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point on, it’s just time to jump on in and roll with things.  I’l looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Just one last day before the bootcamp begins.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Last Dry Run</title><link href="/metis/2018/01/12/Last-Dry-Run/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Last Dry Run" /><published>2018-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/metis/2018/01/12/Last-Dry-Run</id><content type="html" xml:base="/metis/2018/01/12/Last-Dry-Run/">&lt;p&gt;I have been working at the Metis site today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught an earlier train immediately after dropping my daughter off at high school.  It is still rather close
and depends on finding parking and walking to the train stop in time.  But that’s the express train.  It is
actually about two-thirds the travel time.  If I miss that one, the next available train should get me
down here in time before things start for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I caught a curiosity.  I find a remark that a particular event shouldn’t be deemed terribly
noteworthy because it’s still within the customary 5% confidence level.  That seemed like something I could
try to replicate.  I continued that effort today.  For a while I was conviced the comment was wrong
because the significance seemed much greater.  The trouble was that I had missed an implicit assumption
about the data table I was reading.  I replicated the work properly and had to agree with the comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was good about this endeavor, this curiosity, was that I was able to go “out there” and find the
data and bring it back through data cleaning, munging, through Pandas and use the same techniques I’ve
been learning in these MOOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the sort of thing I foresee we’ll be doing a lot in this Metis Bootcamp.  Take the techniques
and go out in the wild to see what fun we can have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the actual instructors are down here.  They’re working through their overall plans since it will
be a team taught experience.  I had a bit of time to talk.  But like Wednesday, I’m not really supposed
to be here.  So when or if they leave, I’ll have to pack up and head out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made good progress in the MOOC.  I should have no problem finishing up the second course before
the bootcamp.  But I may not be able to keep up even a slowed pace on the next two courses.  David (one
of the instructors) was rather skeptical of that idea.  No worries.  The main idea behind the Harvard
series was to prepare me for the bootcamp.  If the bootcamp demands preempts it, this will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent work in this MOOC was interesting.  I had to learn a new Python module as I mirror the
work.  The module is patsy.  It was rather specifically built to mimic or match the functionality
in R.  But… it is slightly different enough to have given me a bit of work to understand it.  The
interesting thing is apparently there are some ways it improved upon the behavior in R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there are a couple of things for this dry run that are simply different from previous trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could I have truly tested the main experiences of the commute if I didn’t do of the typical
commuter things?  It’d be like going to the Alps and not any skiing.  Or going to South Africa and
visiting no wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What experience have I been avoiding?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the laptop while on the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I am not certain I’ll be doing more if it.  I’ve seen folk doing it.  Maybe I’ll be more
like everyone else when I have stuff I want to wrap up or explore.  But, you just end up being so
cramped and squished.  But I’ve proven it in, so to speak.  I’m typing this up as others board the
train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing is that this was the first time I’m returning in the same pattern as I’ll be doing
for the next few weeks.  I made the walk in 18 minutes.  Doable at a fast clip.  But pointless.
There’s an oddity with the train schedules.  There are lots of trains outbound between five and six.
But half or more have express segments, passing many stops including mine.  If I don’t get on a train
shortly after 5, the next viable one is at about a quarter to six.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">I have been working at the Metis site today.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Blog Adolescence</title><link href="/blog/2018/01/11/Blog-Adolescence/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blog Adolescence" /><published>2018-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/blog/2018/01/11/Blog-Adolescence</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2018/01/11/Blog-Adolescence/">&lt;p&gt;The blog has a new front door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may have spent more time on this than I should have.  But it was worthy as an expereince of learning
more about Jekyll, Liquid, SCSS/SASS, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did upgrade to HydeJack Pro to quickly gain some templates for projects.  This provided me a few other
things to consider using.  One of those was sort of natural.  When I started the blog, it was pretty much
just a blog.  I hadn’t yet developed collections or projects, etc.  But once you create a showcase for
Projects, then what is your website?  Should it start folk in the blog and they can then bounce to the
projects?  Or vice versa?  The Hydejack solution is a Welcome page which permits you to select and
highlight a few projects and blog posts.  It’s sort of a “all of the above” answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I went searching for what others had done after trying Hydejack, I saw some other themes in
action.  Indeed, I came across a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rcabanasdepaz.github.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;large&lt;/strong&gt; listing of Jekyll themes&lt;/a&gt;.
I also found a different approach I liked.  This was the Jekyll-Uno theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But… I only wanted that one aspect of Jekyll-Uno - the clean, austere front-door.  So, at the very
least I had to determine how to tack on just that part yet have it integrated well enough with the rest.
Furthermore, Hydejack actually provided better functionality for what to put on that front page.  I didn’t
just want to tack on something extra.  I really had to merge and blend things together.  That’s the part that
was a good working experience in Liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it works well enough, though it may be a bit ugly under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the framework and functionality of the blog should be ready to suit my needs.  And none too
soon since the Metis Bootcamp is just days away.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Jekyll Liquid" /><summary type="html">The blog has a new front door.</summary></entry></feed>
