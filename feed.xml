&lt;p&gt;I have finished the second course in the Harvard series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve given some thought with regards to “what next”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I consider this course series and the book it’s tied to is a very worthwhile experience
overall.  Nonetheless, I’m not entirely certain this was what I expected or that it met my needs
with regards to a refresher on Linear Algebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not get “past” where I’d gotten with my earlier work on HackerRank.  But I certainly went deeper. 
Furthermore, I got a better grounding in how to connect this sort of regression overall to basic
statistics.  And this certainly showed how to use this relative to experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the entire thing.  This whole Harvard series is focused on this one aspect of using statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I fall back and compare the context of this text and course series relative to the Metis Bootcamp
curriculum I can easily see a difference between depth and breadth.  Then when I compare the Metis Bootcamp
curriculum to the broad overview of Data Science topics in general, I can see that even that is but a sampling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… I’m going to pause entirely on the Harvard series for a while.  Instead, I’m going to focus on the
topics covered by the Bootcamp while pushing through a couple other textbooks in the background.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Statistics" /><category term="Harvard" /><summary type="html">Finished with Course Two!!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bootcamp - Final Prep</title><link href="/metis/2018/01/15/Bootcamp-Final-Prep/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bootcamp - Final Prep" /><published>2018-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/metis/2018/01/15/Bootcamp-Final-Prep</id><content type="html" xml:base="/metis/2018/01/15/Bootcamp-Final-Prep/">&lt;p&gt;Just one last day before the bootcamp begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve more or less attained what I’d set out to do to prepare.  I finished the first two courses
in the Harvard series.  I’ve brought the blog to a point where it will serve me during the bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remains any number of things I could have done.  But the time is up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I’ve been tackling a number of normal life things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also backed up the virtual machine I’m using for the bootcamp in a low-tech manner.  I simply copied
the entire thing to a USB stick.  This is the 3rd level of what I implemented.  I’ve got an rsync set to
run daily to dump to another part of the host storage.  I’ve got similar timers to give me period
snapshots.  Next, I’ve got a timer to backup to the cloud.  I plan to copy to the USB stick on a weekly
basis.  All of this should keep me from too much delay from anything from shooting myself in the foot
to theft of the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point on, it’s just time to jump on in and roll with things.  I’l looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Just one last day before the bootcamp begins.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Last Dry Run</title><link href="/metis/2018/01/12/Last-Dry-Run/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Last Dry Run" /><published>2018-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/metis/2018/01/12/Last-Dry-Run</id><content type="html" xml:base="/metis/2018/01/12/Last-Dry-Run/">&lt;p&gt;I have been working at the Metis site today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught an earlier train immediately after dropping my daughter off at high school.  It is still rather close
and depends on finding parking and walking to the train stop in time.  But that’s the express train.  It is
actually about two-thirds the travel time.  If I miss that one, the next available train should get me
down here in time before things start for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I caught a curiosity.  I find a remark that a particular event shouldn’t be deemed terribly
noteworthy because it’s still within the customary 5% confidence level.  That seemed like something I could
try to replicate.  I continued that effort today.  For a while I was conviced the comment was wrong
because the significance seemed much greater.  The trouble was that I had missed an implicit assumption
about the data table I was reading.  I replicated the work properly and had to agree with the comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was good about this endeavor, this curiosity, was that I was able to go “out there” and find the
data and bring it back through data cleaning, munging, through Pandas and use the same techniques I’ve
been learning in these MOOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the sort of thing I foresee we’ll be doing a lot in this Metis Bootcamp.  Take the techniques
and go out in the wild to see what fun we can have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the actual instructors are down here.  They’re working through their overall plans since it will
be a team taught experience.  I had a bit of time to talk.  But like Wednesday, I’m not really supposed
to be here.  So when or if they leave, I’ll have to pack up and head out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made good progress in the MOOC.  I should have no problem finishing up the second course before
the bootcamp.  But I may not be able to keep up even a slowed pace on the next two courses.  David (one
of the instructors) was rather skeptical of that idea.  No worries.  The main idea behind the Harvard
series was to prepare me for the bootcamp.  If the bootcamp demands preempts it, this will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent work in this MOOC was interesting.  I had to learn a new Python module as I mirror the
work.  The module is patsy.  It was rather specifically built to mimic or match the functionality
in R.  But… it is slightly different enough to have given me a bit of work to understand it.  The
interesting thing is apparently there are some ways it improved upon the behavior in R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there are a couple of things for this dry run that are simply different from previous trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could I have truly tested the main experiences of the commute if I didn’t do of the typical
commuter things?  It’d be like going to the Alps and not any skiing.  Or going to South Africa and
visiting no wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What experience have I been avoiding?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the laptop while on the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I am not certain I’ll be doing more if it.  I’ve seen folk doing it.  Maybe I’ll be more
like everyone else when I have stuff I want to wrap up or explore.  But, you just end up being so
cramped and squished.  But I’ve proven it in, so to speak.  I’m typing this up as others board the
train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing is that this was the first time I’m returning in the same pattern as I’ll be doing
for the next few weeks.  I made the walk in 18 minutes.  Doable at a fast clip.  But pointless.
There’s an oddity with the train schedules.  There are lots of trains outbound between five and six.
But half or more have express segments, passing many stops including mine.  If I don’t get on a train
shortly after 5, the next viable one is at about a quarter to six.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">I have been working at the Metis site today.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Blog Adolescence</title><link href="/blog/2018/01/11/Blog-Adolescence/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blog Adolescence" /><published>2018-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/blog/2018/01/11/Blog-Adolescence</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2018/01/11/Blog-Adolescence/">&lt;p&gt;The blog has a new front door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may have spent more time on this than I should have.  But it was worthy as an expereince of learning
more about Jekyll, Liquid, SCSS/SASS, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did upgrade to HydeJack Pro to quickly gain some templates for projects.  This provided me a few other
things to consider using.  One of those was sort of natural.  When I started the blog, it was pretty much
just a blog.  I hadn’t yet developed collections or projects, etc.  But once you create a showcase for
Projects, then what is your website?  Should it start folk in the blog and they can then bounce to the
projects?  Or vice versa?  The Hydejack solution is a Welcome page which permits you to select and
highlight a few projects and blog posts.  It’s sort of a “all of the above” answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I went searching for what others had done after trying Hydejack, I saw some other themes in
action.  Indeed, I came across a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rcabanasdepaz.github.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;large&lt;/strong&gt; listing of Jekyll themes&lt;/a&gt;.
I also found a different approach I liked.  This was the Jekyll-Uno theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But… I only wanted that one aspect of Jekyll-Uno - the clean, austere front-door.  So, at the very
least I had to determine how to tack on just that part yet have it integrated well enough with the rest.
Furthermore, Hydejack actually provided better functionality for what to put on that front page.  I didn’t
just want to tack on something extra.  I really had to merge and blend things together.  That’s the part that
was a good working experience in Liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it works well enough, though it may be a bit ugly under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the framework and functionality of the blog should be ready to suit my needs.  And none too
soon since the Metis Bootcamp is just days away.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Jekyll Liquid" /><summary type="html">The blog has a new front door.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dry Run Report</title><link href="/metis/2018/01/10/Dry-Run-Report/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dry Run Report" /><published>2018-01-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/metis/2018/01/10/Dry-Run-Report</id><content type="html" xml:base="/metis/2018/01/10/Dry-Run-Report/">&lt;p&gt;I have journeyed to downtown Chicago today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be joining the 2018 Winter Cohort of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual activities begin next Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it seemed very prudent to make a number of dry run commutes to work out the kinks.  I’ve been collaborating with Metis for a couple months now
in the sense that I’ve been coming to their facility for a number of meetups and events.  For all of that I simply drove.  Driving to/from Chicago
in rush hour times is a rather undesirable task, but the real kicker is the expense for parking.  To pay the evening rate for an evening meetup is
a lot different than paying every day for a full day’s parking.  In a real sense a car in downtown Chicago is a liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually came down last Friday.  I made that a leisurely affair.  I left shortly before noon.  I brought my young son… who actually helped because he was familiar with mini-DisplayPort adapters.  I haven’t needed to use that sort of connector between laptops and monitors before.  After an our or so playing around with basics of hooking up to the network and external monitors and whatnot, we returned.  Again, it was at our leisure.  We popped into a number of stores along the way back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m trying to match real times.  And (as I kind of expected) I missed my train.  It took a lot longer to find parking at the train station which was also a lot further away.  I thought it was far away last time.  Sheesh!!  But that’s why I’m doing these dry runs.  Nathan, the Metis Chicago Program Manager informs me this cohort will be changing the schedule a bit.  So Friday, I’ll actually take a different train and attempt to get get here by 9am.  Nobody may be here.  Again, there’s no reason for anyone to be here at the moment.  But if so, I’ll just pop on over to UIC and work from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve plopped myself down at a workstation.  I may pick up an adapter to be able to use more than one external monitor.  I’ll be continuing work on the blog and the MOOC I’m pursuing… at least till Nathan boots me out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">I have journeyed to downtown Chicago today.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Blog Enhancements</title><link href="/blog/2018/01/10/Blog-Enhancements/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blog Enhancements" /><published>2018-01-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/blog/2018/01/10/Blog-Enhancements</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2018/01/10/Blog-Enhancements/">&lt;p&gt;I took a brief pause between the first and second courses in this Harvard series to take another look
at a couple of things.  One of the things I need to wrestle with quickly is how to handle projects on
this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I’m using the HydeJack theme.  I could upgrade to the Pro version to get some additional
support for projects.  But I’m not certain I want that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went off on a journey on the web to see how others are using Hydejack or Jekyll in general for projects.
I found a ton of orphaned sites.  Lots of people seem to be starting or barely starting blogs and then
abandoning them.  I may have said earlier, but I find this blog is actually primarily for &lt;strong&gt;ME&lt;/strong&gt;.  If
others are reading this, that’s great.  And this does serve as a bit of a showcase.  But I know from
experience the value of being able to look backwards at logs, journals, etc., of your own work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I’ve also found very little really effective use of these project sections, tabs, pages or whatnot.
But I did find a few.  So I have to ponder what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also reminded I need to go back and fluff out tags and categories.  They end up a bit “messy” in
the site layout if I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also reviewed the blogs created by the 2017 Fall Cohort of the Metis Bootcamp.  These were &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;
project-centric actually.  Maybe I’m just chatty.  But again, experience has taught me that it’s actually
very valuable to be able to look backwards after several months and years to see exactly what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, there really does seem to be a fairly consistent pattern here of portraying projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a front-page of sorts which either uses a picture and one-liner for each project as a link to a more robust page for that project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each project is summarized as a single page which is essentially a summary of the overall project with a focus on the results.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some pages includes links to the previous and next projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some folk used the blog as their mechanism to portray their projects.  But then the blog served almost no other purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… what do I want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at some of the better examples I’ve found using Hydejack Pro…  I found one that rather easily
incorporated links between the (single) post and the project page.  I could do almost the same thing using
a dedicated category page.  In the interest of time, I probably should just upgrade.  I likely won’t take
advantage of everything in Pro.  I’ve found an “Intro” I like better.  I only hesitate because I’d probably
benefit more from building my own stuff in Jekyll.  But I know full well that could eat up a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to move quickly here.  Before the Metis Bootcamp starts, I would like to have back-created a page and some posts related to a project I did last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time passes…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK.  I’m now halfway through the second course and taking some time to work on the blog.  For the purpose
of working in the project functionality, I elevated the previous post on SwirlyPy to a project.  I &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; hope to
keep working on that till it works well enough to serve my needs and help others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While chasing this I found some eye-candy I also want.  But… I’ve reached a point where I have what I want with
regards to the project pages connecting to and from the related blog posts.  So, I’m pushing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Projects" /><summary type="html">I took a brief pause between the first and second courses in this Harvard series to take another look at a couple of things.

&lt;p&gt;I had followed recommendations to this Harvard series when looking for some coursework on Linear Algebra.
That’s this second course in this series.  I chose to back up and do the first course beforehand.  That
was more prudent than I’d thought.  I actually needed that first course as a refresher for Stats more than
I need this.  Furthermore, that first course covers things such as Data Visualization and Data Exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m breezing through this second course for a few reasons.  First, the actual work is similar enough to
what I’d been doing earlier on HackerRank.  So the mechanics are easier.  I’m getting better practice
doing things different ways.  But it’s not the same as figuring out matplotlib stuff trying to do the
same thing in R and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had, at the moment, to summarize the differences between R and Python, it’d be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REMEMBER&lt;/strong&gt; R is 1-based, Python is 0-based&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything in Python is backwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, even within Python you have to be careful.  Does that columns of ones in my coeefficient matrix go on
the right or on the left?  That may depend on what module or function you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I still have a lingering feeling I need to go out and find a raw Linear Algebra refresher.
This course is very tailored towards how to use Linear Algebra for the purpose of statistics.  That’s
good for what I’m doing at the moment though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Statistics" /><category term="Harvard" /><category term="R" /><category term="Python" /><category term="Jupyter" /><summary type="html">Just concluded Week 2 of 4!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stats Series - First Course Done</title><link href="/training/ph_525_series/2018/01/06/First-Stats-Course-Down/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stats Series - First Course Done" /><published>2018-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/training/ph_525_series/2018/01/06/First-Stats-Course-Down</id><content type="html" xml:base="/training/ph_525_series/2018/01/06/First-Stats-Course-Down/">&lt;p&gt;Wow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;strong&gt;DONE&lt;/strong&gt; with the first course: Statistics and R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no significant problem mirroring the entire coursework in R and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But… I learned to be wary of the Python module that lets you directly interface to R.  Oh it &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt; well enough.  Well… it works great in Spyder and Jupyter since the paths are all set up via Anaconda.  I’ve not gotten Rodeo to agree where R is.  But… there are some interesting oddities when trying to convert the data sets available innately in R.  It doesn’t always do what you expect.  To be safe, it’s often better just to dump it to CSV and read it back in from Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to move on to the second course: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Statistics" /><category term="Harvard" /><category term="R" /><category term="Python" /><category term="Spyder" /><category term="Rodeo" /><category term="Jupyter" /><summary type="html">Wow!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Happy New Year</title><link href="/blog/2018/01/01/Happy-New-Year/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Happy New Year" /><published>2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/blog/2018/01/01/Happy-New-Year</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2018/01/01/Happy-New-Year/">&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A LOT is changing for me this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in the midst of a career transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am agressively pursuing training in a variety of forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may end up sliding into working contracts as a Consultant either in place of or in addition to traditional employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was reminded today that you have to be prepared.  Specifically, you have to be prepared for when your machines and data fail… which means you have to have a backup plan.  It probably also would be wise for me to reboot more often… at least to be sure things will reboot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Linux Virtual Machine I’m using for my MOOC studies and Data Science work went belly up.  It was the weirdest thing.  But it was a wonderful object lesson to be careful about how you interpret data.  What one could &lt;strong&gt;SEE&lt;/strong&gt; seemed to be odd errors mostly related to networking when it seemed to fail booting.  Playing with the NIC didn’t do anything.  Only when I booted from a (virtual) DVD-ROM and chrooted into drive to check the logs did I find out what the problem really was… and that the system had indeed booted, complete with networking.  What had failed was SDDM.  Somehow SDDM had gotten updated without a dependency.  A full system upgrade and all was fine…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a good reminder I need a robust recovery plan for my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s my task for the moment.  I’m setting up rsnapshot which will facilitate recovering from my own mistakes.  And I’ll be implementing a cloud backup as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Backup" /><summary type="html">Happy New Year!!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stats Series - Progress</title><link href="/training/ph_525_series/2017/12/28/Stats-Series-Progress/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stats Series - Progress" /><published>2017-12-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-12-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/training/ph_525_series/2017/12/28/Stats-Series-Progress</id><content type="html" xml:base="/training/ph_525_series/2017/12/28/Stats-Series-Progress/">&lt;p&gt;Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the first course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;strong&gt;IS&lt;/strong&gt; taking a bit more time to push through this mirroring things in Python.  But this is proving to be invaluable.  For many things, doing it twice permits me to notice, catch and fix errors.  I’m also using the IDEs to prototype things and Jupyter notebooks more for the ultimate presentation.  This is building for me a library of notebooks for quick reference of how to do particular tasks as well as parallels between R and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using Spyder rather than Rodeo.  I plan to switch for the second half of this first course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have had real problem so far replicating everything in Python, including all the related plots, there is no easy way to make the respective random number generators behave the same way.  I can set seeds for both to keep answers consistent in both.  But they rarely match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing this helps is forcing me to reflect more on understanding what’s really going on rather than just relying on functions and formulae.  There’s an enormous danger here with power of these stats functions.  Statistics builds upon assumptions and methods in a quick chain.  If you just jump to a particular formula without understanding all of what led you to use that formula, you may not appreciate the assumptions nor be as able to change approaches when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joseph Hamilton</name><email>hamilton.joseph.r@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Statistics" /><category term="Harvard" /><category term="R" /><category term="Python" /><category term="Spyder" /><category term="Jupyter" /><summary type="html">Yay!</summary></entry></feed>
