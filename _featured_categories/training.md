The learning never ends.  There's just so much out there to explore and discover.  So many people are
creating new ways of doing things.  Technology keeps changing.

One of the practices I found most rewarding early in my career was to devote time to self-training.  It
quickly became a self-reinforcing cycle.  In this devoted time, you learn ways to do things faster and
better... freeing up more time... which lets you learn more and become even more productive.  Round and
round it goes.

One of the most important things you could ever hope to learn at the University is how to learn.
