Greetings Mr. Hamilton...

Or can we call you Joe?

You see Joe... that's a mighty fine blog ya got there.  Wouldn't want anything to happen to it, now would
we?  We've decided to help you out a bit... yeah... that's the ticket.

In order to protect your site a bit we've locked it down for you to free you up a bit to help us out.

We're in the market for a bit of relocation, ya might say.... yeah!

We's wondering if you might be able to help out with some analysis.  We'd like to know where in Chicago
crime reports have more or less of a chance to end up with an arrest.  We're concerned about... safety...
yeah... that's the ticket.

Let us know what you can do.
